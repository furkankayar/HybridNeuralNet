The main goal of this project is to develop a data specific structure to the classical neural network methods and turn it into an open-source library. Using this new library, even users who are not very experienced in neural networks will be able to develop their models faster without having to deal with hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in hidden layers and initial weights.
